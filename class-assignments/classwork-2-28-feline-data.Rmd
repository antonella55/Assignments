## Loading my first data file

load in the csv file I created.

```{r cats}
cats <- read.csv(file = "data/feline-data.csv", as.is = T) #last part says dont convert characters to a factor
cats
str(cats)
cats$coat #this returns the column that we wrote in csv file; use this to grab any column
cats$weight
cats$weight + 2
typeof(cats$likes_string)
cats$coat #why does it say its an integer? R by default will read character data as factors since its for statistical analysis
as.character(cats$coat) -> dd #now we have them in quotes
typeof(dd) #now its a character/string(in python terms), not factor, but its still a factor in data frame
typeof(cats$coat)
```
