Absolute vs Relative Paths
Amanda could use cd ~  cd   cd .. cd ~/data/..

Relative Path Resolution
ls ../backup will display original pnas_final pnas_sub because we went back into "Users" and then look inside "backup"

ls Reading Comprehension
The command needed will be ls -r -F or ls -r -F /Users/backup

Exploring more ls Arguments
ls -l includes a long list format where the file/directory names are displayed along with file size info and time of last modification.
ls -h makes the file size human readable, simplified/rounded number
